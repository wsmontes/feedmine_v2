# Implementation order

```text
Phase 0 — Architecture scaffold
Phase 1 — Domain models
Phase 2 — Local persistence

Phase 2 does not implement durable FeedEdition/FeedSegment/PublishedCard
storage unless the Publication/Persistence boundary has first been closed.

Content persistence and basic local infrastructure may proceed independently.

Phase 3 — Syndication acquisition
Phase 4 — Canonical admission
Phase 5 — Editorial selection
Phase 6 — Media preparation
Phase 7 — Immutable publication

Publication/Persistence representation boundary must be explicitly resolved
before durable publication history is implemented.

Phase 8 — Feed session
Phase 9 — Adaptive runway
Phase 10 — SwiftUI presentation
Phase 11 — First-launch bootstrap UX
Phase 12 — Background preparation
Phase 13 — Context switching/reuse
Phase 14 — Other product surfaces
Phase 15 — Migration/import from FeedMine legacy where required
Phase 16 — Hardening and release
```
