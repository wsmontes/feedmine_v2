# Implementation order

```text
Phase 0 — Architecture scaffold
Phase 1 — Domain models
Phase 2 — Local persistence

Phase 2 does not implement durable FeedEdition/FeedSegment/PublishedCard
storage unless the Publication/Persistence boundary has first been closed.

Content persistence and basic local infrastructure may proceed independently.

Phase 3 — Syndication acquisition
Phase 4 — Canonical admission
Phase 5 — Editorial selection
Phase 6 — Media preparation
Phase 7 — Immutable publication

Publication/Persistence representation boundary must be explicitly resolved
before durable publication history is implemented.

Phase 8 — Feed session
Phase 9 — Adaptive runway
Phase 10 — SwiftUI presentation
Phase 11 — First-launch bootstrap UX
Phase 12 — Background preparation
Phase 13 — Context switching/reuse
Phase 14 — Other product surfaces
Phase 15 — Migration/import from FeedMine legacy where required
Phase 16 — Hardening and release
```

Viewport movement remains memory-local. An explicit current-position checkpoint operation supplies durability; app lifecycle timing and automatic checkpoint policy remain deferred.

Phases 2G–2I close the local publication/session vertical slice. Phase 3A precedes network acquisition because acquisition needs a canonical authority to admit into; its design gate is [CANONICAL_SUPPLY_DESIGN.md](CANONICAL_SUPPLY_DESIGN.md). Phase 3B1 completed the schema; Phase 3B2 implemented atomic ContentStore changes and exact reads. Phase 3B3 completed bounded candidate windows with 10k/100k evidence sizes, projection-index keyset range/seek and membership-index probes. Source sparsity does not cause refill scanning; no page size or wall-clock SLA is frozen. Phase 3C implements Editorial Candidate and CandidateProvider for Main + Source structural supply. Search remains deferred pending canonical FTS and fails explicitly before a storage window. Each provider call performs exactly one bounded ContentStore window, preserving caller capacity, order, examined count, exhaustion and an Editorial-owned progress cursor. CandidateProvider does not execute FeedPlan policy versions. Phase 3E Selection executes the explicitly supplied matching baseline policy. The macro phase numbering above remains unchanged.

Phase 3D is design only: [SELECTION_DESIGN.md](SELECTION_DESIGN.md) records operator-provided legacy evidence and the deliberate inversion to one caller-supplied finite CandidateSupplyWindow. Selection executes one matching ResolvedSelectionPolicy with explicit no-op eligibility/scoring/exposure and recencyDescending sequencing, preserving honest supply facts. Phase 3E is complete with pure unit tests: no I/O, no refill, no target count, no history/exposure, no scoring weights and no acquisition. Phase 3F now records the design-only Publication boundary; Phase 3G implementation is complete.

Phase 3F is design only: [PUBLICATION_DESIGN.md](PUBLICATION_DESIGN.md) separates Selection intent from ready-to-freeze PublicationCardDraft values. PublicationCoordinator preserves aligned editorial order, construct history from explicit IDs/times/seeds, atomically create Edition + Segment 0 and refuse stale append tails. Preparation/enrichment stays upstream; visibility stays in Runtime/Session. Phase 3G is complete: the indexed-tail append avoids a full-history scan, Coordinator performs no media preparation, automatic retry or global active-Edition discovery, and text-only is a valid prepared baseline. Runtime/Session continues to decide Edition visibility. Phase 3H closes the design-only Media and publication preparation boundary in [MEDIA_DESIGN.md](MEDIA_DESIGN.md). Media returns prepared local facts; future Runtime/orchestration combines them with Selection and other prepared presentation inputs into PublicationCardDraft. Publication owns RenderContract and freezes history; Media never depends on Publication. Phase 3I1 canonical media facts is complete; 3I2/3I3 have not started.

Phase 3I1 implements nominal candidate identity, exact declared visual/image facts and a complete ordered immutable revision-owned collection, atomic canonical admission and historical reads with replay/conflict/corruption/rollback proofs. Its justified fifth canonical table does not change the four-table selection hot path or join CandidateProvider. The remaining recommended sequence, subject to separate phase authorization, is 3I2 local content-addressed asset identity/materialization (explicit bytes, measured metadata, durable key, failure and reopen/local-read proofs), then 3I3 local MediaPreparation and Runtime publication-draft assembly (Media-owned usable facts and first-class text-only). Keep these ownership boundaries separate. Remote acquisition, HTTP, retries, timers, decoded cache, retention/eviction, audio/video download policy, renderer materialization and adaptive runway remain deferred. This branch implements only 3I1; asset materialization remains 3I2 and network remains deferred.
