# Implementation order

```text
Phase 0 — Architecture scaffold
Phase 1 — Domain models
Phase 2 — Local persistence

Phase 2 does not implement durable FeedEdition/FeedSegment/PublishedCard
storage unless the Publication/Persistence boundary has first been closed.

Content persistence and basic local infrastructure may proceed independently.

Phase 3 — Syndication acquisition
Phase 4 — Canonical admission
Phase 5 — Editorial selection
Phase 6 — Media preparation
Phase 7 — Immutable publication

Publication/Persistence representation boundary must be explicitly resolved
before durable publication history is implemented.

Phase 8 — Feed session
Phase 9 — Adaptive runway
Phase 10 — SwiftUI presentation
Phase 11 — First-launch bootstrap UX
Phase 12 — Background preparation
Phase 13 — Context switching/reuse
Phase 14 — Other product surfaces
Phase 15 — Migration/import from FeedMine legacy where required
Phase 16 — Hardening and release
```

Viewport movement remains memory-local. An explicit current-position checkpoint operation supplies durability; app lifecycle timing and automatic checkpoint policy remain deferred.

Phases 2G–2I close the local publication/session vertical slice. Phase 3A precedes network acquisition because acquisition needs a canonical authority to admit into; its design gate is [CANONICAL_SUPPLY_DESIGN.md](CANONICAL_SUPPLY_DESIGN.md). Phase 3B1 completed the schema; Phase 3B2 implemented atomic ContentStore changes and exact reads. Phase 3B3 completed bounded candidate windows with 10k/100k evidence sizes, projection-index keyset range/seek and membership-index probes. Source sparsity does not cause refill scanning; no page size or wall-clock SLA is frozen. Phase 3C implements Editorial Candidate and CandidateProvider for Main + Source structural supply. Search remains deferred pending canonical FTS and fails explicitly before a storage window. Each provider call performs exactly one bounded ContentStore window, preserving caller capacity, order, examined count, exhaustion and an Editorial-owned progress cursor. CandidateProvider does not execute FeedPlan policy versions. Phase 3E Selection executes the explicitly supplied matching baseline policy. The macro phase numbering above remains unchanged.

Phase 3D is design only: [SELECTION_DESIGN.md](SELECTION_DESIGN.md) records operator-provided legacy evidence and the deliberate inversion to one caller-supplied finite CandidateSupplyWindow. Selection executes one matching ResolvedSelectionPolicy with explicit no-op eligibility/scoring/exposure and recencyDescending sequencing, preserving honest supply facts. Phase 3E is complete with pure unit tests: no I/O, no refill, no target count, no history/exposure, no scoring weights and no acquisition. Subsequent gates have not started.
